* if there a user does not have documents just return the empty array

* when verifying tokens, check if a user is in the db first

* roleId should be replaced with role.title since id can change but term cant

* For you sanity checks create a generic function to handle all your checks

* Do not return all

* Vague messages returned in edge cases eg permission denied when no token was given

* Check the information returned when users or a user's information is queried eg if a regular user queries it, only return user facing information - eg name, username; if it's the admin, return more information but leave out the passwords

* Don't return actual catch block errors - return the error message but not the actual error

* Check status codes returned especially in edge cases

* Read on how the jwt signature works and figure out how to mitigate user information access on the front end.

* Be careful about returning private documents

* The same user shouldn't have duplicate docs

* On document search: return the title and content only; not the entire document object

- Remove unnecessary information from user response
- Catch Duplicate errors better and set them to duplicate response error
- Make sure that status response are correct
- Catch errors better
- Implement this route /users/<id>/documents
- Change search user query to /search/users/?q={username}
- Change search documents query to /search/documents/?q={doctitle}
- Change document middleware forbidden response to 403
- Read on jwt signature (Send Kes a slack message or email on how to mitigate that problem)
- Research on how to secure token

* Return only necessary information in the response
* Status codes should reflect the correct error
* Check invalid characters
* Another user should not update another user
* Make search robust
* Unique title
* Reimplement offset and limit


* add the appropriate response codes for the documentation
* document search should include both title and content and the query param is q
* document pagination for both users and documents in the documentation
* error code for duplicate resources and return and appropriate error msg and code
* add a default role for the user model
* only a user can update a users details
* return a more friendly error to use instead of sequelize errors
* a user should be able to get any other users data
* make sure returned user object does not include password field
